# Covid-X-Ray-Data-Analysis
Hi everyone,
This is deep learning model developed for image classification of X ray images of patients having covid with pneumonia and covid without penumonia. 
Implemented in Keras, I used transfer learning concept where using the vgg16 , a pretrained deep learning model is used for feature extraction and then used a custom dense layer for mapping features.

Training accuracy was 99%. Test accuracy was 96%.
